# Nonlinear Project
# Final Project: 24-776
This is the repository for sliding mode control of a quadcopter 

Place all the MATLAB files in the same folder.
sliding_mode_simulation.m should automatically run the SMC problem in nonlinear_quad_plant.slx Simulink file

Replace the exisitng LQR files with the files in repository in mac_att_control folder to implement the SMC.
QuadrotorLQRControl.hpp has all the tunable parameters for SMC implementation.
All the necessary functions for reference are defined within the QuadrotorLQRControl.cpp file. 
Please excuse the file name (but the code implemenatation works seamlessly)
